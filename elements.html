										<h4>Customized Web App Development</h4>
										<p>The web development field is pretty wide. The apps running on various web servers with higher user interaction—typically Facebook, Google Apps, or Netflix—can explain it. For web app development mostly used technologies such as PHP, Javascript, Python, etc.</p>
									    <h4>E-Commerce Development</h4>
										<p>Online shopping is a popular choice for the millennial generation because of its advantages. It is established that online shopping has brought more profits than traditional trade. Most of the companies are looking forward to taking the plunge and going online to sell their products, making high demands for e-commerce website development services.</p>
                                        <h4>CMS Website Development</h4>
										<p>Creating a CMS (Content Management System) website is pretty easy if it has a nice design, is SEO-friendly, and has plugins that fit your needs. These platforms are easy to use and let many people manage data by making, editing, and publishing content.</p>
										<h4>Static Web Service</h4>
										<p>Relatively less popular amongst web services are the static web services, as they are only HTML and their content is rarely changed. The static websites are suitable for purely informational websites.</p>
										<h4>PHP Development Services</h4>
										<p>PHP is a free open-source language and also a suitable scripting language for web development; often, it goes with database software like MySQL. It has a variety of frameworks, packages, and libraries. PHP also gains eminence for its conflicting and apparently poor design, which easily leads to bad codes.</p>
										<h4>Web Development Support and Maintenance</h4>
										<p>The web development companies also offer support and maintenance for your web app after they have completed your project. These include everything from checking your web app for broken links and scripts to updating its content or adding new features. So your web app would be up-to-date.
						                   The web developers can also help with SEO to make sure that your site ranks well in search results or help whenever a problem on your web app arises.</p>
										<h4>Web Hosting</h4>
										<p>Web hosting includes storing your web application’s files on a server that can be accessed from anywhere in the world. Most web development companies will provide you with dedicated server space for your web app as part of their service.
											They are also in charge of keeping software up-to-date, managing servers, making sure security, offering backup services, and giving technical support.</p>	
										<h4>Web Optimization</h4>
										<p>Web optimization is the process of making a web application more user-friendly and visible to search engines. The developers will first check how your web page ranks when it comes to SEO, backlinks, speed, load times, and mobile experience.
											The web optimization also gives you suggestions and other ways to improve the rank of your web app.</p>
